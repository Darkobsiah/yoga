#What I have so far.

This is a minimalistic yoga app. After selecting a routine a gong will sound every minute and display a new pose.
This is all HTML, CSS, and JS inside of a flask application. 

#What I'm working on.

I am trying to get BeeWare https://beeware.org/ to create native applications of this project. The end goal being a person can download the app and use it offline. 
Alternatively I may go with Flutter or some other similar concept.
Using beeware I am having to recreate the whole project since there is a large amount of JS.

#To the future.

I would like to implement something like https://github.com/bhpayne/yoga_graph to create new routines and allow users to create their own routines.
